# Ready when you are. 

_Pretend, for just a minute, that you have one solitary moment to make a stand, and lay out all out, and then move forward. If you had 60 seconds to put down your philosophy, or a manifesto--just put it in ink and don't fuss over it again. What would you say? What would I say? Let's give it a shot:_

I've got a bad conscience. I can see the violence in life, in my history, my country, my founding mythologies. What's worse, the more I distance myself from the violence, the more of a hypocrite I become. You can hate war, and guns, and that asshole tearing down the street by your house in his monstrous pickup. I can hate the competitive hunger in people--why can't we just be? The truth is, the human race is the most violent force on earth, not because they have an special moral bent, but because they have the greatest capacity for ambition, and achievement. Our race is one long story of conquest, of pillaging and raping. The environment, the natives, the poor, whatever. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4b5d7c42750647e72037e2f754c03f1961825e55.jpg)

But the fact is, my life is the same story. I live in this land because we took it with fury. I live in comfort because I pay for the capitalist luxuries which only slavery can give. Our slaves live on the other side of the planet. Those who can't cope are rolled over, and because of that fact, I get my coffee, my phone, my speed, and my clothes. I want to get away, to unplug, to need and want less, to consume only what is pure and natural. I want to buy a dozen or so acres, and farm it. And I would be peaceful then, right? Hardly. This land was taken by blood and It is kept by blood. I pay the taxes, and the taxes buy the missiles. I can buy the land, but only because I have the cash, which so few have. I got the cash from my wealth grandparents, and I don't know how they got it, but capitalism made it happen. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5c6b44db-6b6f-49ec-bcfc-bd465ba03bde.jpg)
